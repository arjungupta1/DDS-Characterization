# DDS-Characterization
This repository contains Matlab code that helps plot the characteristics of any DDS (Direct Digital Synthesizer).
The code is specialized towards a particular application where the signal needed to be normalized relative to a DC blocking filter.
The output of the DDS was fed into a Rhode & Schwarz Power Meter (NRP-Z) and data was collected on a logarithmic x-scale from 1 MHz to 200 MHz.
This data is significant because it allows the user to see the amplitude response to frequency changes over a large number of scenarios.
